=============================
 Roadmap To Learn Natural Language Processing(NLP)

level 1 :text preprocessing => tokenzation , lemitization ,stopwords ,steming ,etc

level 2 :level 2 text preprocessing => bag of words , onehot encoding ,TFIDF ,unigram|bigram|trigram|ngram

level 3 : word2vect - 1.cbow , 2.skipgram, genism ,

level 4 : solve ML usecases

level 5 : get understanding of ANN (Artifical Nureal Network), loss function ,optimizer

level 6 : embaded layer => word2vect DL pov

level 7 : RNN , List RNN ,encoder ,decoder ,atention models

level 8 : Transfarmer 

level 9 : BERT
 
level 8 and 9 also called hugging face 

with all we use nltk , spacy , pytorch

I did changes in this file to make it modified for github
